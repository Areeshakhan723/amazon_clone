# amazon_clone

An Amazon Clone using HTML and CSS replicates the visual design of Amazon’s website, including the header, navigation bar, and product grid layout. It features a responsive design for various devices and mirrors the look of Amazon’s product listings, search bar, and footer. This project focuses purely on front-end aesthetics without back-end functionality.
